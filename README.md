#  Customer-Centric Financial Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

A multi-page interactive Power BI dashboard designed to simulate a real-world business informatics use case for a financial services company. The dashboard provides deep insights into AUM trends, customer behavior, product performance, service quality, and digital engagement — supporting decision-making across business and technical teams.

##  Objectives

- Track AUM, contributions, and withdrawals over time
- Compare product performance based on ROI, risk, and fee revenue
- Analyze customer growth, segmentation, and retention
- Identify patterns in service satisfaction and support resolution
- Visualize digital engagement trends and device adoption

>  *Data is synthetically generated using Python to match realistic patterns.*

##  Synthetic Data Generation

The synthetic data used in this project is generated using Python scripts located in the `docs/` folder. The scripts leverage the [`Faker`](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library to create realistic-looking but entirely fake customer, transaction, and interaction data.

###  Script Location
- docs/generate_synthetic_data.py

###  Dependencies
Install required packages:

--- pip install faker pandas numpy
Run the script using
--- python docs/generate_synthetic_data.py
